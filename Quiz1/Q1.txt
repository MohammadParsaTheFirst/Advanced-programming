**Seeking Fame**

* Time Limit: 1 second  
* Memory Limit: 256 megabytes  

Mohsen and Ali, after a stressful workday, decided to invent a simple game. Mohsen handed Ali a grid of English letters and asked him to check whether a specific word existed in the grid or not. Ali, to showcase his skills, decided to write code for the task instead of spending time on this not-so-interesting game.

### Input:
First, the dimensions of the grid \( n \times m \) are provided in the first line.  
\( 1 \leq n, m < 100 \)

Next, the word that Mohsen asked Ali to find is given.  
To locate the word, its letters must be connected sequentially (each letter can be positioned either above, below, to the left, or to the right of the previous letter *and each letter in the grid can be used only once*).  

After this, each line contains \( m \) English letters (guaranteed to be uppercase).

### Output:
If the word exists in the grid, print "peyda kardam!" (found it!), otherwise print "nabood!" (not there!).

### Example:
**Sample Input 1:**  
```
4 5  
MOHSEN  
A M P M A  
V T E O Q  
A H S H W  
H P E N F  
```

**Sample Output 1:**

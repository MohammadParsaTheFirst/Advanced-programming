This time, Ali and Mohsen are participating in a computer game. In this game, there are \(n\) missions numbered from 1 to \(n\). The two friends can complete the missions to gain experience points and strengthen their characters. The rules for completing the missions are as follows:

1. Mission 1 is always available to complete.  
2. Mission \(i\) can only be completed if all previous missions (i.e., missions 1 through \(i-1\)) have been completed at least once.

Ali and Mohsen can complete each mission multiple times. Every time they complete a mission, they earn experience points:  

- The **first time** they complete mission \(i\), they gain \(a_i\) experience points.  
- **Subsequent completions** of the same mission earn \(b_i\) experience points.  

The two friends have limited time and can complete at most \(k\) missions in total. Your task is to calculate the **maximum experience points** Ali and Mohsen can gain.

### Input:
1. The first line contains two integers, \(n\) and \(k\) (\(1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \times 10^5\)), representing the number of missions and the maximum number of missions they can complete, respectively.  
2. The second line contains \(n\) integers (\(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\)), the experience points gained from completing each mission for the first time.  
3. The third line contains \(n\) integers (\(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^3\)), the experience points gained from subsequent completions of each mission.

### Pointers

- **Time Limit**: 1 second  
- **Memory Limit**: 256 MB  
- **Note**: Since this question is designed for learning about pointers, the use of arrays, vectors, structs, and classes is prohibited!  

The goal of this question is to implement simple versions of some array-like functions using pointers.

---

### Functions:

1. **`insert`**: Adds the given value to the end of the "array."  
2. **`pop`**: Removes the element at the given index from the "array."  
3. **`swap`**: Swaps the elements at the given indices.  

**Note**: Indices start from 0.

A command is also provided to display the elements of the "array" in the order they were added (`print`).

---

### Input
The input consists of one operation per line, which corresponds to one of the described functions. Input continues until the user types "exit."

Commands:
- For `insert`:  
  `insert <int>`  

- For `pop`:  
  `pop <index>`  

- For `swap`:  
  `swap <index 1> <index 2>`  

- For `print`:  
  `print`

### Output
Output is only required for the `print` command, showing the elements in the "array" in the order they were added.

---

### Example Input 1:
```text
insert 5  
insert 6  
insert 7  
insert 8  
print  
swap 0 1  
print  
pop 3  
print  
exit  
```

**Example Output 1**:
```text
5 6 7 8  
6 5 7 8  
6 5 7  
```

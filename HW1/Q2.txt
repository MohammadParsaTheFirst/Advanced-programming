Robin Hood and his friends have decided to raid the sheriff of Nottingham’s tax train wagons. The team’s informant has provided the following information, in order:

The time required to break the lock of each wagon.

The color of each wagon (gold or silver).

The time when the castle’s reinforcement forces will arrive.

Since moving between wagons takes time, Robin Hood wants you to calculate the following to help him:

Find a sequence of length K of wagons, such that all wagons in the sequence are golden, and the total time to break their locks equals the castle’s reinforcement arrival time.

If such a sequence does not exist, find a sequence of length K with the minimum possible total lock-breaking time.

Input:
The input consists of several lines, each containing:

time (the time required to break a lock)

color (the color of the wagon).

Each line includes one integer (time) and one string (color).

The input ends with the keyword end, which indicates the end of wagon data. It is guaranteed that the keyword will always appear in this format.

Afterwards, two natural numbers K and T are provided (on the same line, separated by a space):

K: the number of wagons in the sequence.

T: the time when reinforcements will arrive.

Output:
Your program should output the index of the first wagon in the sequence (indices start from 1).

Example Input 1:
text
4 Gold  
3 Silver  
1 Silver  
2 Gold  
1 Gold  
end  
2 3  
Example Output 1:

text
4  
Explanation: The fourth and fifth wagons are both golden, and their combined lock-breaking time equals the reinforcement arrival time.

Example Input 2:
text
4 Gold  
3 Silver  
1 Silver  
4 Silver  
1 Gold  
1 Silver  
end  
2 4  
Example Output 2:

text
5  
Explanation: There are no consecutive golden wagons of length 2. The sequence with the minimum lock-breaking time is wagons 5 and 6.
